    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>Hi, I'm Matthias Hutsebaut-Buysse. My mission is to create meaningful value through technology. I began my career as a software engineer, but in 2018, I became captivated by the remarkable advancements in machine learning. This passion led me to pursue a PhD in Reinforcement Learning, where my research focused on developing transfer methods for learning-based navigation problems, enabling robots to acquire new tasks more efficiently.</p>

    <p>
    Outside of my professional life, I consider myself a maker with a wide range of interests, including homebrewing, electronic music production, woodworking, and electronics. I enjoy applying my creativity and curiosity to hands-on projects that bring ideas to life.</p>
