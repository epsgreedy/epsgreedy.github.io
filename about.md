Hello, my name is Matthias Hutsebaut. My interests include reinforcement learning (in which I'm currently pursuing a PhD), deep learning, robotics, software development and Home Automation.

This is a personal blog in which I document my progress in various technical endeavors. I mainly do this in order to become a better writer and share things which might be remotely useful for other people (and robots).

If you are interested in getting in touch, you can always do so by emailing me. I abide by the ``firstname.lastname@gmail.com`` pattern.
